# Command Groups

(More information [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/commandbased/command-groups.html).)

Now that we've planned and written out our drivetrain trajectories, it's time to fuse those together with our robot's other capabilities. 

So far, we've only gone through writing **individual** commands and their respective subsystems. However, what if we want to make more complex robot actions? One might want to run multiple commands simultaneously on a single button press. This is where a `command group` comes in.

As the name indicates, command groups are combinations or collections of multiple commands. Thus, what they really do is allow multiple *subsystems* to be run synchronously. 

Command groups compose multiple commands into one whole, allowing a program to be kept simple and clean. Overall, they allow for reduction in code complexity. One thing to note is that *command groups themselves are commands*--this means that command groups can contain other command groups as components, and so on.

Command groups are essential for autonomous routines, really making them *a lot* easier to program. Remember 254's four cube auto? Although they write a lot of their own custom controls and don't fully rely on WPILib's helper classes, their performance is still a perfect example of running subsystems concurrently, especially how the elevator is raised and lowered so smoothly together with the intake.

The command-based library supports **four** basic types of command groups: `Sequential`, `Parallel`, `ParallelRace`, and `ParallelDeadline`. Types `ParallelRace` and `ParallelDeadline` are similar to `Parallel`, but each have their own unique qualities. 

## Sequential

A `SequentialCommandGroup` allows for commands to be run in a defined sequence. The program moves forward in the sequence one-by-one as each command finishes, until the sequence is complete. Therefore, it is *imperative* that each command in the list is able to actually end--otherwise, the sequence will stop prematurely.

## Parallel

The `ParallelCommandGroup` allows for commands within it to run simultaneously. This group ends once *all* commands inside have finished.

## ParallelRace 

First, the `ParallelRaceGroup` runs its commands concurrently, just like the `ParallelCommandGroup`. However, the `ParallelRaceGroup` ends when *any* command inside finishes; all other commands still running are interrupted at that time. 

## ParallelDeadline

A `ParallelDeadlineGroup` is almost exactly like the `ParallelRaceGroup`, except it ends when a *specific* command is complete (the "deadline" or stopping point). Like before, all other commands are interrupted when the group reaches the deadline (if they haven't ended already).

## Creating Command Groups

To create a command group, simply subclass one of the built-in WPILib command group classes described above. Let's go through an example with an intake and drivetrain in 2019's Destination: Deep Space.

```java
...

public class ShipFrontCommand extends SequentialCommandGroup {

    public ShipFrontCommand(Drivetrain drivetrain, Intake intake) {
        addCommands(
            new DriveDistanceCommand(autoDistance, drive),
            new EjectCargoCommand(intake),
            new TurnLeftCommand(90, drivetrain) // degrees
        );
    }
}
```

This is a `SequentialCommandGroup` that moves the robot forward a certain distance towards the nose of the cargo ship, ejects the pre-loaded cargo, and then turns left. Of course, this assumes that `DriveDistanceCommand`, `TurnLeftCommand`, and their respective parameters are defined, and that the necessary import statements are present. The class itself is the command group, and inside the constructor, we use `addCommands()` to *add* the appropriate commands, in sequence.

Note: a command group would be bound to controller input in the same way an individual command would.

### Restriction Note

It is important to note that the robot program will throw an error if a command is scheduled both *independently and from within a command group* at the same time. For instance, in the example above, it would be problematic if the `ShipFrontCommand` command group was called at the same time as `TurnLeftCommand`, since `TurnLeftCommand` would end up being called from multiple places at once.

Now let's take a look at a more complex example, taken from 1257's robot code for 2020's Infinite Recharge.

```java
public class TrajDriveAndShoot extends ParallelDeadlineGroup {

    public TrajDriveAndShoot(Drivetrain drivetrain, Indexer indexer, Shooter shooter, Trajectory trajectory, Intake intake) {
        super(new SequentialCommandGroup(
                new SetRobotPoseCommand(drivetrain, trajectory.getInitialPose()),
                new DriveTrajectoryCommand(drivetrain, trajectory),
                (new IndexerShootCommand(indexer, shooter, () -> true)).withTimeout(INDEXER_DUMP_TIME)),
            new ShooterPIDCommand(shooter)
        );
    }
}
```

A few things: 
- IMPORTANT: The *first* command passed into a `ParallelDeadlineGroup` is automatically set as the deadline (i.e. first parameter = deadline).
- We subclass `ParallelDeadlineGroup`.
- A `SequentialCommandGroup` is passed in as a command itself (perfectly valid!) to run both the drivetrain and indexer commands.
    - This inner group acts as the deadline of the outer group.
- During all this, `ShooterPIDCommand` is run the entire time to keep the shooter wheel spinning.

Note that `addCommands()` is nowhere to be found. This is because we wanted to be able to call `TrajDriveAndShoot` *itself* as a `ParallelDeadlineGroup` in our other routines. Otherwise, we would've had to write out `TrajDriveAndShoot`'s inner commands in *every* routine, which wouldn't be very efficient.

We use `super()` as a way to grab `ParallelDeadlineGroup`'s constructor since we are subclassing it, and then pass in the appropriate commands. This allows us to reference `TrajDriveAndShoot` as a `ParallelDeadlineGroup object`, and use it in the other routines. 

### Timeouts

Timeouts are a nice convenience feature provided by WPILib that allows us to decorate our commands with a time limit (see the full list of convenience features [here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/commandbased/convenience-features.html)). One application of timeouts would be in autonomous. 

Most of the commands we write for our subsystems do not have a specific end condition, hence why `isFinished()` in the commands always returns `false`. We don't specify anything in `isFinished()` since our commands are bound to buttons and triggers, and start/end based off of those controller inputs.

So, if we want to use our teleop commands in autonomous, we can use `.withTimeout(VALUE)`, where `VALUE` is a time limit in seconds.

If we look at the example above, we see `.withTimeout(INDEXER_DUMP_TIME)`. This means that `IndexerShootCommand()` will be run for `INDEXER_DUMP_TIME`
s value in seconds, launching the power cells as a result.

## Trajectory Auto

We've gone through two command group examples--now let's get into auto routines that include drivetrain trajectories (from 1257's 2020 auto):

```java
public class TrajTopTrenchAuto extends SequentialCommandGroup {

    public TrajTopTrenchAuto(Drivetrain drivetrain, Indexer indexer, Shooter shooter, Intake intake) {

        Trajectory topTrench1 = Trajectories.getTrajectory("Top-Power");
        Trajectory topTrench2 = Trajectories.getTrajectory("Power-Trench");

        addCommands(new TrajDriveAndShoot(drivetrain, indexer, shooter, topTrench1, intake), 
            new DriveTrajectoryCommand(drivetrain, topTrench2));
    }

}
```

Not too bad, right? Here's a breakdown:

<img src="img&gif/2020FieldDiagram.jpg" width="600">

- We use our `Trajectories.java` generation class and grab two separate paths, one for driving up to the target zone ("Top-Power"), and one for going from the power port to the trench ("Power-Trench"; red trench from this diagram's view). 
- The "Top-Power" trajectory is passed into `TrajDriveAndShoot`, which is from the previous example; this allows the robot to shoot power cells while following the trajectory. 
- Then, `DriveTrajectoryCommand` has the drivetrain follow the secondary path to the trench. 
- Here, `addCommands()` is used so that the inner commands will actually be *scheduled*, or run by the [CommandScheduler](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/commandbased/command-scheduler.html). 
    - This isn't like before, where we were creating a command group as an independent class to be used elsewhere.

The main takeaway here: the bulk of the work is done in `Trajectories.java` and the trajectory-following code. This command group is simply what brings everything together in a cohesive manner. 

We would use the same principles to program the other robot routines (because of varying trajectories), therefore completing our autonomous!
