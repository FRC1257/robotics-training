# Annual Updates

## Goals

This section is a crash course on every component, page, or set of files that likely need to be updated each year, roughly in order of importance.

Each subsection will consist of two main parts: a brief tutorial on how to update a particular component and a more verbose explanation on how the components actually work together. The former will quickly get you up to speed with what needs to be changed, but the latter (somewhat optional) portion will help you gain a better understanding of the code base if bugs were to arise.

The latter sections are a work in progress.
