# Objects {docsify-ignore-all}

## Goals

* Learn how to make utility classes to organize code
* Learn OOP concepts
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
* Learn how to make classes and objects
* Learn the difference between static and non-static methods
* Learn what interfaces are

## Tasks

* Person
  * Create a person class that includes variables for name, age, eye color, hair color, height, etc.
  * Create a constructor to initialize these variables.
  * Create a function that prints all of its properties.
* Create a class called Point that includes an X and a Y coordinate.
  * Create a function that takes in another Point object and returns the distance between the two.
  * Create a function that takes in another Point object and returns the midpoint between the two.
* Pokemon
  * Create a class called Pokemon which includes HP, Speed, Defense, and Attack which are integers on a scale of 1-10.
  * It should also includes its type which is included in an enum class.
  * Create a function that allows a Pokemon to battle another given Pokemon and deduct health dependent on defense and attack.
  * Bonus: Implement types that make certain Pokemon stronger and weaker against others.
