# Velocity PID

Similar to positional PID control, there are a few ways of implementing velocity PID control. We will go over two methods here: the WPILib `PIDController` and the SPARK MAX onboard PID.

## Purpose

We might want to use velocity PID for three primary reasons:

1. Ensuring our mechanism reaches a consistent speed for something such as a shooter's flywheel
2. Motion profiling, which we will cover later
3. More precise control of something like the drivetrain.

We will cover the first use case in this lesson, the second case in a few lessons, and the final one in the future (most likely in the autonomous or advanced section).

## General Info

Velocity PID control is very similar programmatically to positional PID control. Instead of using the constants `kP`, `kI`, and `kD`, we instead use `kFF` and `kP`. It is very rare that we will use `kD` or `kI` in velocity PID control, especially the latter. Essentially, the `kFF` term will be multiplied by the target velocity and added to the output, which will be the primary driving force for our controller. Then, the `kP` term will account for any small errors in the output and slightly modify the output to account for those. As a result, we will be using a combination of **feedback and feedforward control**.

To implement this, we first need to create the PID constants in our `Constants.java` file. Note that we add an extra term for the `kFF` term.

Additionally, we will define the max speed of our shooter here, which will be important later. We actually define our `kFF` term as `1 / SHOOTER_MAX_SPEED` at first. This is normally a really good approximation for what the `kFF` term should be, assuming that `SHOOTER_MAX_SPEED` corresponds to the actual speed limit of our motor. We can later tune this further, but this normally gets us really close.

We use the units RPM here, aka revolutions per minute. We *could* use whatever units we wanted here, as long as we are consistent. This means that we need to make sure to apply a scaling to our encoder values to ensure this is valid. However, SPARK MAXes actually have their default units set to revolutions per minute, making that unnecessary.

```java
public static class Shooter {
    ...
    public static double SHOOTER_MAX_SPEED = 5000.0; // RPM
    public static double[] SHOOTER_PIDF = new double[] {0.0001, 0, 0, 0.0002};
}
```

## WPILib PID

Now, we will cover how to implement the subsytem functions if we are using WPILib's `PIDController`. We will update the initialization step of our subsystem as follows. We will first add the `VELOCITY_PID` state, define our `PIDController`, and configure the constants. We don't have to scale our encoder values because we are using SPARK MAXes.

One thing we have to note is that we are actually not passing our `kFF` constant into the `PIDController`. WPILib's `PIDController` does not actually support feedforward, but it is simple to implement. We will instead use WPILib's `PIDController` to handle just the feedback section.

```java
public class Shooter extends SnailSubsystem {

    public enum State {
        MANUAL,
        VELOCITY_PID
    }

    private CANSparkMax shooterMotor;
    private CANEncoder encoder;

    private PIDController shooterPID;

    private State state = defaultState;
    private double speed;

    public Elevator() {
        shooterMotor = new CANSparkMax(SHOOTER_PRIMARY_MOTOR_ID, MotorType.kBrushless);
        encoder = shooterMotor.getEncoder();

        shooterPID = new PIDController(SHOOTER_PIDF[0], SHOOTER_PIDF[1], SHOOTER_PIDF[2], UPDATE_PERIOD);
    }

    ...
}
```

Next, we will have our `update()`, `setSpeed()`, and `endPID()` functions, which will handle, set, and end our `VELOCITY_PID` state respectively.

```java
@Override
public void update() {
    switch(state) {
        case MANUAL:
            shooterMotor.set(speed);
        break;
        case VELOCITY_PID:
            // add our feedback and feedforward outputs together
            double output = shooterPID.calculate(encoder.getVelocity()) + 
                SHOOTER_PIDF[3] * shooterPID.getSetpoint();

            shooterMotor.set(output);
        break;
    }
}

public void setVelocity(double setpoint) {
    state = State.VELOCITY_PID;
    shooterPID.reset();
    shooterPID.setSetpoint(setpoint);
}

public void endPID() {
    state = State.MANUAL;
}
```

One thing to notice is that we do **not** define an end condition for our velocity PID. This is typically because we don't actually want to end our velocity PID automatically, since the purpose of it is to **maintain** a certain velocity, not accomplish a single motion. The velocity PID will be frequently cancelled by how we set up our commands. We will see this in a moment. Before we do that, we will cover how to implement the subsystem for SPARK MAX PID.

## SPARK MAX PID

Before we get onto making the command, we're going to also review how you could use the onboard SPARK MAX PID as well for velocity mode. To construct the controller and input our constants, we can have the following relatively self-explanatory code. Note that unlike the `PIDController`, the onboard SPARK MAX PID supports `kFF`, so we can can give it the constant.

```java
public class Shooter extends SnailSubsystem {

    public enum State {
        MANUAL,
        VELOCITY_PID
    }

    private CANSparkMax shooterMotor;
    private CANEncoder encoder;
    private CANPIDController shooterPID;

    private State state = defaultState;
    private double speed;

    public Elevator() {
        shooterMotor = new CANSparkMax(SHOOTER_PRIMARY_MOTOR_ID, MotorType.kBrushless);
        encoder = shooterMotor.getEncoder();

        shooterPID = shooterMotor.getPIDController();
        shooterPID.setP(SHOOTER_PIDF[0]);
        shooterPID.setI(SHOOTER_PIDF[1]);
        shooterPID.setD(SHOOTER_PIDF[2]);
        shooterPID.setFF(SHOOTER_PIDF[3]);
    }

    ...
}
```

Similar to the `PIDController` section, we also need to make our functions for controlling the PID states. The functions are pretty simple and self-explanatory.

```java
@Override
public void update() {
    switch(state) {
        case MANUAL:
            shooterMotor.set(speed);
        break;
        case VELOCITY_PID:
            shooterPID.setReference(Constants.Shooter.SHOOTER_VEL_SETPOINT, ControlType.kVelocity);
        break;
    }
}

public void setVelocity(double setpoint) {
    state = State.VELOCITY_PID;
    speed = setpoint;
}

public void endPID() {
    state = State.MANUAL;
}

```

## Velocity PID Command

Our command for controlling velocity PID is pretty simple, and the code is below.

```java
public class ShooterVelocityPIDCommand extends CommandBase {

    private Shooter shooter;
    private double setpoint;

    public ShooterVelocityPIDCommand(Shooter shooter, double setpoint) {
        this.shooter = shooter;
        this.setpoint = setpoint;
    }

    @Override
    public void init() {
        shooter.setVelocity(setpoint);
    }
    @Override
    public boolean isFinished() {
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public void end(boolean interrupted) {
        shooter.endPID();
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to implement the button bindings in `RobotContainer`, which is also relatively simple. This is also how we define when the command will end (when the button binding goes inactive). For instance, here we are binding it so that the command is run as we hold the A button, but when we release the A button, the command will terminate.

```java
public class RobotContainer {
    ...

    public void configureButtonBindings() {
        operatorController.getButton(Button.kY.value).whileActiveOnce(
            new ElevatorPIDCommand(elevator, Elevator.SETPOINT_TOP));

        operatorController.getButton(Button.kX.value).whileActiveOnce(
            new ElevatorPIDCommand(elevator, Elevator.SETPOINT_BOT));
    }
}
```

## Tuning Velocity PID

Creating graphs of the desired output and the actual output is **crucial** for velocity PID to not only see how accurate you are, but also how well you are tracking the desired velocity as it changes or as interference is introduced to the system.

1. Set all terms but `kFF` to `0`
2. Set `kFF` to `1 / MAX_SPEED`
3. Tune only the `kFF` value as much as possible until you get a pretty good approximation of the desired value. Using a graph is **crucial** for this step. To do so, you need to output both the target velocity and the current velocity in the same graph.
4. Once you've gotten the best results possible with just `kFF`, gradually increase `kP` to account for small fluctuations until you get the desired results.

## Velocity Control

We can not only use velocity PID to obtain a desired set speed, but also for better control. With our typical methods of control, we pass the controller joystick output to the motor directly, which will move the motor. However, this can be imprecise and the motor might not track the desired velocity perfectly. Especially for drivetrains, we may choose to use velocity control on our subsystem instead, where we convert our joystick values to a desired velocity and send that to our velocity PID. This is generally referred to as **closed loop velocity control** compared to the typical **open-loop control**. This is most often applied to a drivetrain for more precise control.
