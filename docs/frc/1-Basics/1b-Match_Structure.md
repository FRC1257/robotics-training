# Match Structure

## Autonomous vs. Teleoperated

Competition matches are divided into two main periods: *autonomous* and *teleoperated* (teleop). In autonomous, the robot can move/score independent of driver control, running *solely* on pre-written code (there are exceptions to this in some years, e.g. 2019, where both driver control and autonomous routines were legal). Subsequently, in teleop, the robot is controlled by the drive team.

Once the match starts, autonomous begins and it lasts for 15 seconds. Then, teleop begins and lasts for 135 seconds. The match ends when teleop ends.

During the autonomous period, we generally want to score points and position the robot appropriately for the beginning of teleop. Thus, we tend to do a lot of preparation for this period. (See the [Autonomous section](https://frc1257.github.io/robotics-training/#/frc/4-Autonomous/README) for more details.)
