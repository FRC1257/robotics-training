# Making Simulation Classes (Roller Intake)

New for 2024 and will be updated soon. 
For now, take a look at this [repository](https://github.com/FRC1257/virtual-robot) with a bunch of common simulated subsystems (arms, elevators, intakes, etc.)
Also, look at this documentation for simulated system [classes](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/wpilib-tools/robot-simulation/introduction.html).
