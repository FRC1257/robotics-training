## Libraries

To program robots, we use a combination of Java and WPILib. Essentially, there is a lot of code that goes into programming robots, most of which is incredibly complicated and time-consuming. As a result, to help access things like motors, time things like the different robot periods, and manage complicated procedures like PID, we use already written code. All of this code is compiled into something called a library called WPILib.

## WPILib

WPILib contains a lot of classes that help with managing motors, sensors, and sync your robot. They also give different structures for maintaining the flow of the robot program.

## Programming Environment

For robot programming, we use something called Visual Studio Code, which offers a lot of features as well as the ability to compile and deploy robot code (if you install the WPILib extension). However, for learning it is essential for you to get as much practice as possible on your own, so if you do not have a computer available we can use direct editing in GitHub with our robot template. We will go over how to make a template project from this in the Basics section.

## About Import Statements

In this section, there will be a lot of `import` statements that pull code from other sections. In some code examples, we may have all of the required `import` statements, in some we may have too many, and in some we may have too few. We won't pay particular attention to this because when we program the robot, peer-review it, and check it, we will have IDEs that can automatically generate these `import` statements.

## Examples

One of the best ways to learn robot programming is to try stuff out and look at examples. I would strongly recommend that you look at our 2020 code since it is one of the best examples we have of our current programming architecture and style.
