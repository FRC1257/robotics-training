# System Identification Tool in WPILib
    The WPILib system identification tool consists of an application that runs on the user’s PC and matching robot code that runs on the user’s robot. The PC application will send control signals to the robot over NetworkTables, while the robot sends data back to the application. The application then processes the data and determines model parameters for the user’s robot mechanism, as well as producing diagnostic plots. Data can be saved (in JSON format) for future use, if desired.
