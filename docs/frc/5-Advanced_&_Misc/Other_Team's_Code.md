# How to Look at Code from other Teams
The code that we have in this training is just a small sample of what we have done in the past. There are many other teams that have code that is publicly available. This is a great resource to learn from and to see how other teams do things.

## Teams to look at
There are a lot of teams that consistently put out good code. Here are a few of them:
- 254
- 971
- 1678
- 118
- 148
- 2363
- 1114
- 2056
- 1923
- And my personal favorite, 6328

You can find their code on GitHub. Just search for the team number and FRC. For example, here's [254's code](https://github.com/Team254)

## What to look for
Most teams use Java, so their structure will be similar to our code. Read through each project's read me first to make sure you have everything setup correctly. Then, browse through their `src` folder and look at the general structure of their code. Once you see all the different subsystems they have, you can look through their `RobotContainer.java` file to see how everything comes together and how they interact with their robot. Depending on the complexity of the project, there might be a lot of code to look through. It's best to go line by line and understand what each line does, but when its not easy to do that, try to get the gist of how the code works together. Some teams might use a different style for their code. For example, [6328](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/RobotCode2023/blob/main/src/main/java/org/littletonrobotics/frc2023/RobotContainer.java) has their own logging system and loves command factories this makes it hard to understand at first. If you have any questions about how a team does something, feel free to ask a mentor or more experienced student on the programming team. 

Some teams have their own libraries which they use throughout their code. These can also be useful to learn more about how they do things. 

## Looking for interesting code
It's a good idea to keep an eye on what other teams are doing to improve their performance. Try to look at other team's autos or other automation in their matches to see if there is something that we can use on our own robot. Watching matches and other team's robot presentations is helpful for this.
